Personal Website
================ 

This is my personal website. I created this to share a little bit more about myself, as well as to write about things I find interesting in technology, and show case some projects.
You can visit the website by following http://agasmi.me

I built the website using Ruby 2.1.1, and Rails 4.2.2.
Feel free to look at the Gemfile if you'd like to see what other technologies were used.
